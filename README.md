# Benchmark
Simple 3-Layer-NN to improve on benchmarks used in https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05731, as I find their selection of benchmarks arbitrary, if you are trying to have a fair comparison. 
The resulting accuracy of 0.99269 (error rate of 0.731%) improves on their (note: they take this benchmark from an unpublished paper on http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) of a 3-Layer-NN with 500 and 300 neurons with an error rate of 1.53%, as well as their own 3-layer SVM-DSN (1.49% error rate) drastically.
