# Benchmark
Simple 3-Layer-NN to improve on Benchmarks used in https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05731, as I find their selection of benchmarks unfair and arbitrary. 
The resulting accuracy of 0.99269 (error rate of 0.731%) improves on their used benchmark of a 3-Layer-NN with 500 and 300 neurons with an error rate of 1.53% as well as their own 3-layer SVM-DSN (1.49% error rate) drastically.
